So the name of this design basically means winged tarantula, but that just doesn't sound as fancy. But don't worry, fortunately these monsters don't exist. Anyway, I really like how this model turned out. The design process was much shorter than I expected. It's a pretty straightforward box pleated design, not too much to precrease (still not particularly easy to collapse or shape)."
